## What do I do ?

I already know about Python, C, C++, Lua, Rust, and many more ; I'd love to learn even more.

I **LOVE** learning about new stuff, and I usually code a lot in my spare time.

I started my journey with computers when I was 10 with unity copying and pasting code around,
then I learned python when I was 12, and now I'm working on a bunch of different projects.
My two biggest are the [_Da Programing Language_ (link coming soon)](/TODO), and
a [Voxel Engine (link comming soon)](/TODO).

When I'm bored I really like doing little physic-simulations with [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

### I also like people (I know, weird for a dev huh ?)

I helped a manager to manage teams as a dev, basically teaching again programming and HTML to devs.

Correcting errors, or should I say, horrors, like the famous (/irony) HTML tag `<FONT size='5pt'>`.
