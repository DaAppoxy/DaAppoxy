## _`$ whoami`_ ?

> I'm a dev who ‚ù§Ô∏è everything about `computers` and $math$.

I handle a bunch of different languages, mainly python for prototyping and then
C for production.

I **LOVE** learning about new stuff, and I usually code a lot in my spare time.

I started my journey with computers when I was 10 with unity copying and pasting code around,
then I learned python when I was 12, and now I'm working on a bunch of different projects.
My two biggest are the [_Da Programing Language_](https://github.com/TheDaProject) (a highly customizable C
with modern cool features), and a [Eupie](https://github.com/TheEupieProject) (a more accessible math writing
tool because accessibility matters). I'm currently solo-ing all of this, but if someone wants to join do not
hesitate. Also, I'm heading toward a CS PhD.

When I'm bored I really like doing little physic-simulations with [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).
