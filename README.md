## What do I do ?

I handle a bunch of different languages, mainly python for prototyping and then
C for production.

I **LOVE** learning about new stuff, and I usually code a lot in my spare time.

I started my journey with computers when I was 10 with unity copying and pasting code around,
then I learned python when I was 12, and now I'm working on a bunch of different projects.
My two biggest are the [_Da Programing Language_](https://github.com/TheDaProject) (a customizable C), and
a [Eupie](https://github.com/TheEupieProject) (a more accessible LaTeX). I'm currently solo-ing all of this,
but if someone wants to join don't hesitate.

When I'm bored I really like doing little physic-simulations with [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib).

### I also like people (I know, weird for a dev huh ?)
